# Steel-and-Glory
Text-Based RPG set in a demonic dungeon, crawling with threats. Fight your way out by using different weapons and taking the time to heal when you need to.

First in a series of projects to improve my Python skills while also letting me unleash a bit of creativity.

AI was used to provide skeleton outlines for the concepts I was unfamiliar with, specifically with save/load functionality. Also used to identify unknown syntax errors and help with O.O.P concepts.
